# Titanic-Survival-Prediction---Machine-Learning-GUI-Application
This project is designed to predict the likelihood of a passenger's survival on the Titanic based on various passenger details. It leverages data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques, culminating in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to input passenger details and receive survival predictions.
